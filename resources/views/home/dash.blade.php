                            Dash is one of the easiest to use cryptocurrencies in the world, and it has a particular
                            focus to effectively making payments. However, a lot of people try to mine Dash so
                            competition is high. In this article we will outline everything you need to know to make a
                            solid profit mining Dash – including your choice of hardware, setting up your mining rig and
                            how to use mining pools to get a regular income stream.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We will also explain how cloud mining works for Dash, many miners prefer using a third party
                            service for mining because buying and setting up hardware can be complicated and technical.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            Why mining Dash is a great idea
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The security of a cryptocurrency is absolutely central to its functionality. Dash is a great
                            choice in this respect, because it uses the X11 algorithm alongside a Proof-of-Work
                            mechanism. There are benefits to using X11 as the hashing algorithm – X11 uses a combination
                            of 11 hashing algorithm which makes it very difficult to build an ASIC-based mining rig.
                            <br> <br>

                            It is also more difficult for scammers and hackers to abuse the X11 algorithm, because it
                            requires creating 11 different ASIC mining machines to be able to hack through all 11
                            hashing functions. In practice, doing so is almost impossible. What does this mean for
                            people who mine Dash? It means that your mining earnings will be safe.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            How to efficiently mine Dash
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            A lot of individuals and groups try to mine Dash which makes mining Dash very competitive
                            compared to other coins. As a result, ASIC mining is currently the most effective way to
                            mine Dash coins – mining with a CPU or a GPU is not feasible when it comes to Dash. <br>
                            <br>

                            It took a while before a Dash ASIC miner appeared, but a company called Ibelink created the
                            first ASIC mine that can mine coins based on the X11 algorithm. In contrast to the ASIC
                            miners used to mine the SHA-256 algorithm used for Bitcoin, an X11 ASIC miner needs less
                            computational brawn and therefore uses less power. <br> <br>

                            At the moment there is really one ASIC mining rig which you should consider – it’s the
                            Antminer D3 which is made by a company called Bitmain. This company’s miners are well known
                            for consuming relatively low levels of electricity because they are highly efficient, the
                            company is also set to roll out new models in future. Keep in mind that Antminer usually
                            does not include a PSU when you buy the mining rig, you need to purchase this separately.
                            <br> <br>
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            The essential components for mining Dash
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            When you mine Dash it’s mostly the hardware you need to worry about, and everything related
                            to your mining rig – mainly because you will be using an ASIC mining rig to mine Dash. You
                            do need a wallet as well because this is where you receive your mining proceeds. In summary:

                        <h3>
                            Things you should think about before you start to mine Dash
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Note that an ASIC miner can generate quite a lot of heat and noise – which brings up a
                            maintenance issue. You need to make sure that your mining rig stays cool at all times, and
                            need to be aware that noise can become a problem under certain conditions. So we suggest you
                            read up on noise and ventilation issues before you start mining. <br> <br>

                            With regards to your internet connection, note that it’s not just about bandwidth – you
                            should really get a connection with low latency. Low latency means that you can submit your
                            mining results more quickly, which improves your chances of claiming a block reward. If you
                            are on a high-latency connection you might find that you submit your block result after
                            someone else already submitted the same result, and you won’t get the block reward. <br>
                            <br>

                            Also note that mining means sending quite a lot of data over the internet, this could be
                            about 0.5GB per day so about 15GB per month. On most connections this won’t be an issue but
                            it is worth checking. <br> <br>

                            Three ways to mine Dash <br> <br>

                            You can mine Dash in one of three ways – as a solo miner, using a mining pool or by mining
                            in the cloud. In theory mining solo will render the highest profits, but the problem with
                            mining solo is that it can take a very long time to solve a complete block – you could get
                            lucky and find one fast, or it can take an excessively long time to find a block, during
                            which time you’d need to pay your electricity bill. <br> <br>

                            We think mining in a pool is a better idea because it means that you will get more regular
                            rewards, even if these rewards are smaller on an individual basis. Take care however when
                            you choose a Dash mining pool – look at how the pool distributes rewards, what the latency
                            is to the pool and of course what the fees are. <br> <br>

                            Your last option for mining is cloud mining – in other words, a third party operates the
                            mining hardware and you rent the capacity. We will cover this further in a later segment in
                            this article. <br> <br>

                            Setting up a Dash wallet <br> <br>

                            You need to store your earned coins somewhere, so you need a Dash wallet. Both desktop
                            wallets and mobile wallets will work, as long as the wallet can store Dash coins. If you
                            don’t think you will keep large amounts of Dash stashed away at any given time you should
                            consider a web or desktop wallet as these are easy to use. For storing large amounts of Dash
                            we recommend something hardware-based such as the Trezor or the Ledger Nano S. <br> <br>
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            Finally, we recap what you need to think about before you start mining Dash:
                        </h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cooling and ventilation to make sure your ASIC rig performs well around the clock
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Whether the noise created by an ASIC miner will be a problem
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                What you’ll do about regular maintenance – think about clearing dust away for example
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>
                            Which Dash mining rig should you buy?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            It used to be possible to simply use a standard desktop computer to mine Dash but the mining
                            difficulty of Dash has gone up – now you need a powerful ASIC rig to mine Dash. ASICs are
                            application specific integrated circuits, ASICs designed to mine Dash are very efficient at
                            solving the cryptography equations that lead to block rewards. ASICs can solve these
                            equations much more quickly than normal computers. As a result, you can mine much more
                            quickly.
                            <br> <br>

                            Each mining rig has a different hash rate, but you should look at both hash rate and power
                            consumption when you evaluate an ASIC miner – because power consumption will show up on your
                            electricity bill. Our calculator below will help you work out how much you can earn using a
                            specific rig.

                        <h3>
                            Setting up your Dash mining rig
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            It can sound difficult to get a Dash mining rig set up, but in truth it’s not hard at all –
                            it is very simple to do. Below we list all the essential steps you need to take to get your
                            rig ready and up and running to mine.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Set up the ASIC rig you purchased <br> <br>

                                Connect your PSU to the control board and all the hashing boards on the ASIC rig – make
                                sure it’s all connected. Next, ensure you connect your network cable to the rig too so
                                your rig has internet access. Don’t forget to plug in your power supply, and give your
                                device a few seconds to boot when you switch it on.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Sign up with a mining pool <br> <br>

                                You need to register with a Dash mining pool of choice and then log in so you can add
                                your wallet address so rewards can be distributed. Look for the Setting page which
                                should give you all the necessary options.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Add workers to your mining pool account <br> <br>

                                Add your ASIC rig as worker in the mining pool – you’re looking for an option like “Add
                                Worker”, you need to give your ASIC rig a name too.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Retrieve the pool URL <br> <br>

                                Have a look at your pool dashboard – you will find a list of URLs, ending in port
                                numbers like 6099, 25 and 443. These are the mining pool URLs.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Enter your miner’s config page <br> <br>

                                Navigate to your miner’s IP address (you can find this on your router or using the
                                miner’s software tool). Next, in miner configuration, enter the pool URL you picked up
                                above and also add your pool username. It’s worth entering URLs for multiple pools to
                                enable failover.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Save your configuration and restart your rig <br> <br>

                                Give your miner a few minutes after restarting it to ensure it boots up. Watch out for a
                                hash rate appearing, this indicates that your ASIC rig is now functioning properly. Also
                                note the hashrate so you can calculate your profits.

                        <h3>
                            Mining Dash in the cloud
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            It’s possible to avoid buying mining equipment and to save on the expense of doing so – and
                            the complexity of setting it all up. If that’s your preference you should consider making
                            use of cloud mining instead. <br> <br>

                            Cloud mining is popular for a range of different cryptocurrencies and it means that you
                            don’t need to worry about electricity consumed, keeping equipment cool and setting up
                            configurations. It’s simply a matter of signing up for a contract with a cloud mining vendor
                            who “rents” their hardware to you. It’s easy, but you should think about the pros and cons.
                            <br> <br>

                            The pros of mining in the cloud include the fact that there’s no heat or noise to deal with
                            and you don’t have to worry about your power bill. You don’t own the hardware so won’t
                            suffer the losses when your hardware becomes obsolete. Furthermore, the cloud mining
                            provider will do all the configuration for you – you don’t need to set anything up. <br>
                            <br>

                            Drawbacks of mining in the cloud include the risk of a scammer or fraudster taking your
                            cloud mining payments and not returning anything. Also keep in mind that you lose a degree
                            of profits because the cloud mining vendor will be shaving off a profit to cover their own
                            costs. Finally, there is a drawback in not owning the mining equipment yourself. <br> <br>

                            However, setting up with cloud mining is really easy – all you need to do is to choose a
                            provider that you like, and to enter into a contract with them. Think about MinerGate,
                            Nicehash.com and of course MiningRigRentals. <br> <br>
                        </p>

                            Calculating your Dash profits
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Of course, before you spend money on a mining rig, you need to make sure that you can
                            generate sufficient profits through your mining activities. So, we have provided a simple
                            calculator that can step you through it – providing you with an earning’s estimate base on
                            the inputs provided by you alongside current mining difficulty and of course the price of
                            Dash. <br> <br>

                            Make sure you enter accurate numbers for your rig’s hash rate, it’s power consumption and
                            the fee charged by your mining pool. When you click calculate you’ll get an output outlining
                            the profits you make on an annual, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly basis. For cloud
                            mining, we only require you to enter the hash rate you purchased, and your mining contract
                            fee. <br> <br>

                            Note that even though we provide a good indication of your profits, the volatility of Dash
                            prices alongside the variability of mining difficulty can quickly change how much profits
                            you earn – so check back often, and know that your profitability can change quickly. <br>

                            Common questions about Dash
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Can my raspberry pi be used to mine Dash? <br> <br>

                            Yes, but your raspberry pi is not really powerful enough – it will take forever to mine a
                            Dash coin with it, so we suggest you don’t even try. <br> <br>

                            Can I make a profit mining Dash?<br> <br>

                            Yes, but it really depends on a number of variables – our calculator will be able to tell
                            you, based on your inputs.<br> <br>

                            What are the laws around mining Dash?<br> <br>

                            Most countries do not have any laws governing cryptocurrency mining, but note that you might
                            need to pay taxes on your mining revenue.<br> <br>

                            Can I use my phone to mine Dash?<br> <br>

                            Android or iOS handsets can be used to mine dash, but it would be almost impossible to make
                            a profit and mining Dash with your phone means it will be at risk of overheating.<br> <br>

                            What are the safety concerns around mining Dash?<br> <br>

                            Make sure your hardware is always cool, and ensure you join a mining pool you can trust. If
                            mining using a cloud provider, make sure you choose a provider you can trust too.<br> <br>

                            When will the very last DASH be mined?<br> <br>

                            There is a limited number of Dash coins that can be mined. It looks like the last Dash coin
                            will be mined in 2030.<br> <br>

                        <h3>
                            More information about Dash
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Dash was developed with a strong focus on the payments industry, but Dash is nonetheless an
                            open-source, P2P cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin. It can be spent securely both offline and
                            online thanks to the fact that it is a money-centric cryptocurrency – in other words it is
                            portable, easy to acquire and easy to divide into smaller units. On top of all these
                            achievements there is also the fact that the transaction fees for Dash is relatively low.
                            <br> <br>

                            Dash inherited all the key features of Bitcoin, but it’s added in several ways. For example,
                            you can instantly send Dash coins thanks to its InstantSend function, while you can also
                            choose to privately send Dash coins thanks to the PrivateSend function. <br> <br>

                            Other interesting features about Dash includes the fact that Dash is based on a model which
                            implies self-funding, and self-governance. In essence the Dash network can pay people or
                            companies to do work for the network – if that work contributes to the network. <br> <br>

                            You may have heard of a DAO – a decentralised autonomous organisation. The way Dash was
                            designed has meant that Dash is one of the first DAOs. <br> <br>

                            Dash developers say that the maximum number of Dash coins that will ever come into
                            circulation will be 18 million coins. As people mine DASH more and more coins will come into
                            circulation, the expectation is that all 18 million DASH will be in circulation by 2030.

                        <h3>
                            The team behind DASH
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Dash is open source, and decentralised. The way it is governed and funded means that it
                            makes it easy to create independent entities which can support the Dash network. Development
                            of Dash is driven by Dash Core Group Inc., the company is in charge of managing the Dash
                            project as well. <br> <br>

                            Dash Core Group have a range of departments which work together to ensue that Dash is
                            supported thoroughly – including devops, management, marketing and business development and
                            a department which supports overall strategy. Dash Core Group has an HR department too as
                            well as a dedicated finance department. A range of senior advisors and external parties
                            contribute too and the network has a number of close associates.

                        <h3>DASH algorithm</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Dash hashing algorithm has a number of advantage and disadvantages. The positive points
                            about the algorithm driving DASH include the fact that it is secure, effective and
                            relatively easy to mine – including low cost of power. <br> <br>

                            On the flipside, the hashing algorithm used for Dash has some disadvantages – we’re not
                            convinced of its longevity and it is somewhat vulnerable to botnet attacks. There is little
                            in the way of a network effects too and we don’t think the community around the hashing
                            algorithm is all that extensive. <br> <br>

                            So, while the X11 algorithm is unique and highly effective the extent to which it is
                            successful will depend on a couple of its essential features, and whether the Dash team can
                            prove the ability to maintain longevity and to ensure the coin remains effective. If so it
                            might illustrate that X11 is a good algorithm for any altcoin. <br> <br>
                        </p>

                            P-o-W Consensus
                        </h3>

                        <p>Dash uses proof-of-work consensus, but users can earn rewards on top of the proof-of-work
                            system by opting to run a master node, users running master nodes get additional rewards for
                            running this special server. Dash is similar to many other coins because of its
                            proof-of-work mechanism. Each Dash block contains two parts:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A header which includes important parameters such as when the block was created, a
                                reference link to the block prior to it plus a Merkle tree root which covers the
                                transaction block.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                A block list of all transactions in that block
                            </li>

                            DASH forks
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Every cryptocurrency has a source code, or protocol that operates it. A fork is essentially
                            a change to that source code – you could see it as a change to the rules that governs a
                            cryptocurrency too. You get two different types of forks:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A soft fork means that the new rule set works just fine with the old rule set
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                In contrast, a hard fork implies what is really a brand new coin – the rules are
                                incompatible
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            DASH has been forked a lot of times – think for example of Crown, SAFE or PIVX. In fact,
                            Dash isn’t a brand new coin, it was forked from Bitcoin. Dash was forked from Bitcoin
                            because it was intended to fix some problems with Bitcoin. As a result, some of the biggest
                            flaws and issues of Bitcoin doesn’t exist in Dash which means, in particular, that there is
                            a big difference in efficiency. Dash is offers greater anonymity while also performing
                            faster compared to Bitcoin.
