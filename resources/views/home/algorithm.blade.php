                            X11 algorithm <br> <br>
                            The clue is in the name – X11 algorithm is basically a mining algorithm which takes eleven
                            other algorithms and stitches its altogether into a single mining algorithm. Its constituent
                            algorithms are: Blake Bmw Cubehash Echo Groestl Jh ... <br> <br>

                            Scrypt algorithm <br> <br>
                            The defining characteristic of Scrypt is that mining it uses a lot of memory, and that it
                            also takes a lot time to perform selection. Scrypt is used when mining cryptocurrency and
                            Scrypt makes it more difficult for ASIC miners to compete in mining a ... <br> <br>

                            Ethash algorithm <br> <br>
                            All Ethereum-based coins use Ethash algorithm. Ethash is a tweak of SHA3-256, SHA3-512
                            algorithms to try and make mining more resistant to ASICs, but still easy enough so that the
                            network can easily verify it. It’s a proof-of-work algorithm, th... <br> <br>

                            Equihash algorithm <br> <br>
                            Dmitry Khovratovich and Alex Biryukov created and developed the EQUIHASH algorithm. Biryukov
                            is a professor from the University of Luxemburg, working in computer science. Khovratovich
                            works independently as a post-doctorate researcher with a focus on... <br> <br>

                            CryptoNight Algorithm <br> <br>
                            The CryptoNight algorithm is CryptoNote and Bytecoin’s (BCN) proof-of-work algorithm and it
                            was designed to allow CPU miners to work on equal terms. It’s not about driving a wedge
                            between PC and ASIC miners, rather it’s about alloca... <br> <br>

                            The Dagger-Hashimoto Algorithm <br> <br>
                            The Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm must have the most heroic-sounding name of them all. Ethereum
                            uses a proof-of-work algorithm called Ethash, and the Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm was the
                            first version of that. Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum team created... <br> <br>

                            SHA256 Algorithm <br> <br>
                            The NSA designed the SHA-256 algorithm along with the other SHA-2 cryptographic hash
                            functions. The initials stand for Secure Hash Algorithm. A cryptographic hash function is a
                            mathematical operation that runs on digital information. The output you g... <br> <br>
